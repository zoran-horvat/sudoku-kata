# Sudoku Kata
Coding practice demonstrating an awfully long method. Try to refactor this method.

This entire exercise consists of one function (static method `Play` in the `Program` class). It has around 1,000 lines of code and it implements entire Sudoku game following these steps:

1. Construct a fully solved Sudoku board - this step ensures that there is the solution
2. Remove certain number of digits from the board - this step constructs initial board which is guaranteed to have at least one solution.
3. Try to find a rule which concludes that one digit can be added to the board.
4. Repeat step 3 while new digits are being added to the board.

Final source of the `Play` function is the starting point for refactoring. Complete exercise consists of refactoring the `Play` function into a complete object model. There are no correct and incorrect solutions to the exercise - try to go as far as you can with building a better object-oriented solution which is still doing the same thing as the original function.
